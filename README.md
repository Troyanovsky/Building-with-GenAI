# Building with GenAI
Tutorials and example projects for building applications using generative AI.

This repository contains code and tutorials for leveraging generative AI models to create powerful applications. The tutorials explore the capabilities of these models across various modalities, including:

- Input: Look, Read, Listen 
- Actions: Think, Move 
- Output: Write, Draw, Say

## Build with GenAI: Turn Rambling into Coherent Writing
Learn how to turn voice recording into coherent writing with Whisper V3 Turbo and a locally hosted LLM. This project combines listen, think, and write capabilities.
