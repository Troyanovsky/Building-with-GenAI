# Building-with-GenAI
Tutorials and example projects for building applications using generative AI.

This repository contains code and tutorials for leveraging generative AI models to create powerful applications. The tutorials explore the capabilities of these models across various modalities, including:

- Input: Look, Read, Listen 
- Actions: Think, Move 
- Output: Write, Draw, Say 

## Build with GenAI: Generative AI Search with Local LLM
Learn how to build a generative search engine powered by a locally hosted LLM. This tutorial demonstrates how to perform online searches with local LLM. This project combines read, move, and write capabilities.
